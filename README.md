## Problem statement

To explore, analyse and identify the overview from starbuck_world_stat data set on Tablaeu file.However, to deep dive on analysis I've come up with another dataset which is sastifactory of starbuck customer. The final model will be able to determine whether the customer will be loyal to company or not.

## Installation

Programming language

-Python 3.X 
-Google colab
-Numpy
-Pandas
-Matplotlibs
-Seaborn

Non-programming lagnguage

-Tableau

## Notebook file

The Data Exploration, Data wrangling and Feature Engineering phases are in the Stabuck_loyal_customer_ML_prediction.ipynb file. 

## Data type

dtypes: int64(7), object(14)

## Process

Data gathering >> Data visualization >> Prediction

## Reflection

The exploratory analysis should tell us the overview of Starbuck world stat and the classification on ML model predict the loyal more than 90% accuracy and top 5 features important to deploy the data to other departments
